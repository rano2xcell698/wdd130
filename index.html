        <p class="box">Hello! My name is Chukwunwike Williams Okonkwo. I am a student of BYUâ€“Idaho from the eastern part
            of Nigeria,
            Delta State. I currently reside in Lagos State, one of the business hubs of the country. I am excited to be
            here and learning web development. <br>Iâ€™m a lifelong learner with a passion for teaching, digital
            innovation, and
            personal growth. Over time, Iâ€™ve developed interests and skills across diverse fields including SAP
            Materials Management (SAP MM), software development, digital business, and career coaching. I enjoy helping
            people grow through training and mentorship, particularly in areas like caregiving where I
            offer structured training services, and in career coaching, where Iâ€™m building expertise to guide others in
            achieving their professional goals. Iâ€™m also an entrepreneur at heart. Iâ€™m actively working on creating a
            digital businessâ€”exploring opportunities in e-commerce and print-on-demandâ€”with a clear vision of building
            sustainable income streams.
            At the same time, Iâ€™m developing a mindfulness app using C# and object-oriented principles, which reflects
            both my technical
            curiosity and my commitment to improving well-being. Education, technology, and faith guide much of what I
            do. I believe in continuous improvement, ethical
            practices (like neurosales done right), and creating solutions that genuinely add value to peopleâ€™s lives.
